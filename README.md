# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



###  My website features :

- My website has a vast collection of books, and it is very user-friendly.

- New users can borrow any book by filling out a form here and gaining insights about the book. They will be able to borrow it for a few days.

- Users can create a PDF file of a specific page from the book if they want.

- Users can add a book if they want and update information about a book as well.

- I have used a dark theme on my website so that people can browse beautifully in the darkness of night.
